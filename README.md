)# hello-world
Tutorial repository

I'm supposed to write something clever about myself for the Github tutorial and I've used far more time
trying to figure out what to write than what I think is intended. Imagine being so afraid to write something
uninspirational on a "hello-world"-github tutorial page that you end up writing nothing at all. 

In the half an hour I have spent, a few things have crossed my mind though. For instance, my mind have stumpled
upon a few worn-out Chinese proverbs, none of which was good enough to post here. However, I do find some 
reconsiliation in the fact that: "Deep doubts, deep wisdom; small doubts, little wisdom".

Paradox: "A paradox is a self-contradictory or counter-intuitive statement or argument".

When re-reading what I have just written, two things appear to me. First, I was supposed to write something about 
myself, which hasn't really been the case. Secondly, even though I have not explicitly written anything about
myself, what I have written, actually holds much more information as to who I am. 

  - I use an hour writing a hello-world-readme, that no-one probably reads. (Perfectionist - To the extent that it
  borderlines unhealthy)
  - I choose to write about the fact that I cant come up with anything and underlines how pathetic that is. (Having
  just entered the 5th and final month af writing my master thesis, I am on the brink of an existential crisis)
  - What I end up writing is a flow of thoughts, each containing a paradox and finish it all off with a 
  definition of a paradox. (Occasionally pretentious, but with something on my mind)
  - Last but not least, I end up actually completing the task, having written so little about myself, but yet so 
  much. (I always come through at the end)

Best,
Mikkel Holm
